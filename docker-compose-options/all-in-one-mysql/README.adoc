= MySQL/MariaDB All-In-One - Low Volume Option

This is an example of the https://docs.featurehub.io/installation.html#_option_2_low_volume_deployment[low volume option] talking to a MySQL/MariaDB database. Most Cloud providers allow you to
deploy single containers and this will let you do that.

Beware that because all Edge traffic routes to the same container as your Admin application, excess Edge
traffic will cause performance issues with your Admin app.

Please note that MySQL is a tier-2 "support" option. We test against Postgres and H2 on a day-to-day basis and
rely on the user community for failure feedback. The drivers included are MariaDB drivers.
