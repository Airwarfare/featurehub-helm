= Environment Variable based Postgres All-In-One - Low Volume Option

This is an example of the https://docs.featurehub.io/installation.html#_option_2_low_volume_deployment[low volume option]
talking to a Postgres database. Most Cloud providers allow you to
deploy single containers and this will let you do that. It is designed to show
how you can use environment variables instead of a properties file to set the parameters that FeatureHub
requires.

In this case, the Postgres still uses a init.sql file to create the database and schema that will be used by
the FeatureHub Server, but it is expected you will do this in your Pulumi / Terraform / Terragrunt / etc
infrastructure as code.
