= Oracle XE All-In-One - Low Volume Option

This is intended to be a testbed for the Oracle database support. Oracle drivers and Oracle database migrations
were included as of FeatureHub 1.5.4. This container setup is not intended for production use.

please note that as Oracle tags a LONG time to start, the party server will keep failing to start and restart itself
until Oracle does come up.
