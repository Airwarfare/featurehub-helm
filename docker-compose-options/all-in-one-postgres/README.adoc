= Postgres All-In-One _Example_

This is an example of  the full stack in a Postgres container for demo purposes. It is _not_ expected you would
run like this in production, but if Postgres is your flavour of database, this is what you would choose.

The main reason you would not expose your environment like this is that as load increases on your Edge, it would
deny service to your Admin tool.
