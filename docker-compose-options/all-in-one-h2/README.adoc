= All in One Demo

This is intended to allow you to demo the FeatureHub Stack in a simple single container. It uses the on-disk
H2 database and should never be used for production use because of this.

The only difference between this and the "low volume" options is the database.

This refers to https://docs.featurehub.io/installation.html#_option_1_evaluation_deployment[Evaluation Deployment]
