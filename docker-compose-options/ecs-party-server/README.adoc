= ECS Postgres All-In-One Example

This is an _example_ of  the full stack using a Postgres container for demo purposes. It is designed to show
how you can use environment variables instead of a properties file to set the parameters that FeatureHub
requires.

In this case, the Postgres still uses a init.sql file to create the database and schema that will be used by
the FeatureHub Server, but it is expected you will do this in your Pulumi / Terraform / Terragrunt / etc
infrastructure.
